### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Lin, my pronouns are he/him.
I'm a full stack software engineer with a particular interest in front-end development and UX/UI. I am an General Assembly fellow that will graduate in July. 
I am currently learning about Django and Python.

I hope to collaborate with more of my classmates in the future on more passion projects. 
I am always looking for advice and help with further developing my knowledge and skills in the software programming landscape. 

I'm always down to talk or have a good debate about food, movies, video games, sports or 90s tv and music.
